# Stage 2: Model download
# The candle embedding engine downloads model weights from HuggingFace Hub
# via the hf-hub crate on first use. We pre-download by running "warmup" in
# this stage so the runtime image ships with the model already on disk — no
# internet access required at pod startup, and cold-start latency is eliminated.
#
# HF_HOME controls where hf-hub caches downloaded models. We set it to an
# absolute path under the app user's home directory.
