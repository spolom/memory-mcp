# Stage 2: Model download
# fastembed downloads models from HuggingFace into its cache directory on first
# use. We pre-download by running "warmup" in this stage so the runtime image
# ships with the model already on disk — no internet access required at pod
# startup, and cold-start latency is eliminated.
#
# FASTEMBED_CACHE_DIR must be set to an absolute path — fastembed defaults to
# `.fastembed_cache` relative to CWD, which fails when CWD is not writable.
