//! Semantic memory engine with pure-Rust embeddings and git-backed storage.
//!
//! This crate provides the library core for `memory-mcp`, an MCP server that
//! stores and retrieves memories using vector similarity search. Embeddings
//! are computed on-device via candle (BERT inference) with no C/C++ FFI.
